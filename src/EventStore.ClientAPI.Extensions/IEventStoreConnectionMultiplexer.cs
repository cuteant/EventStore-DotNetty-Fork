  /// when you use a SqlConnection. If you prefer the usage pattern of using(new Connection()) .. then you would likely
  /// want to create a FlyWeight on top of the <see cref="IEventStoreConnectionMultiplexer"/>.
  ///
  /// Another difference is that with the <see cref="IEventStoreConnectionMultiplexer"/> all operations are handled in a full async manner
  /// (even if you call the synchronous behaviors). Many threads can use an <see cref="IEventStoreConnectionMultiplexer"/> at the same
  /// time or a single thread can make many asynchronous requests. To get the most performance out of the connection
  /// it is generally recommended to use it in this way.</remarks>
